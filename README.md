# 16-Step-Sequencer

### Introduction:  
For the the final term project, Alex and Nathaniel chose to create a musical synthesizer based on the Digilent Nexys A7, highly influenced by the Korg Electribe series.  The EA-1 was an analog-emulating digital synthesizer produced in the late 90â€™s, featuring two polyphonic channels.

### Design goals: 
We wished to use the EA-1 as an inspiration, as well as a heavy influence on the user interface.  To that extent, we intend to design the following:
16 channel polyphonic sequencer: 
1. 16 independent channels of sound, each with: 
  * ADSR filter
  * 2 octave note range
  * Sine, square, and noise waveforms
  * Hardware switch enable/disable
2. Variable tempo control
3. Fully functioning 7-segment display detailing menu options
